# fractal-generator

Fractals are geometric structures that display self-similarity on infinitesimal levels: zooming in on any part of a fractal will result in a structure identical to the entire fractal.

This is a program that creates Koch snowflakes and fractal trees - two of the most renowned and identifiable fractals - based upon parameters provided by the user.
This allows for the generation of a variety of unqiue and interesting fractals.

The program uses recursion for generation, adhering to the intrinsic self-similarity which defines fractals. 
It showcases the vast uses and benefits of recursion, and how some processes are naturally recursive.
